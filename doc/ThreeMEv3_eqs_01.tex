\section{Supply-Use equilibrium}



This section provides the equations defining the supply use - equilibrium for the domestic and imported products and at the agregate level. It also derives the GDP according to various definitions. All equations are therefore accounting identity. \\  \\
Each identity is expressed in value and in volume. The value equation defines therefore a price index. By convention, the variable $Z$ is always expressed in volume. $PZ$ is its price. Therefore the quantity expressed in value is $Z^{VAL} = PZ * Z$. In most case, values are expresed as $PZ * Z$. When there is a risk that a variable in volume is equal to zero in simulation, we shall defined value as $Z^{VAL}$ to avoid a division by zero issue. A typical exemple would be the value-added of sector $s$: $VA^{VAL}_{s} = PY_{s} \; Y_{s} - PCI_{s} \; CI_{s}$.

\end{dmath}



\subsubsection{Margins received (value \& volume):}



The margins received by commodity $cc$ corresponds to the margins supplied by this commodity. By definition, the margins received is the sum of the margins paid (or used) on the commodities $c$. \\ \\
The margins paid on domestic and imported products ($MGPD_{cc, c}$ and $MGPM_{cc, c}$) are defined with behavorial equations in the producer block. They follow the domestic and imported production of commodity $c$ ($YQ_{c}$ and $M_{c}$) more or less proportionnally depending on the possibility of substitutions between margins. The margins paid are then agregated to define the margins recieved, $MGR_{cc}$. The latter is then disagrated between the domestic and imported margins recieved ($MGRD_{c}$ and $MGRM_{c}$). See specification in the producer block. \\

\noindent\textbf{Market price of the margins received by commodity $cc$} \\
\begin{dmath}
PMGR_{cc} \; MGR_{cc} = \sum_{c} PMGP_{cc, c} \; MGP_{cc, c}

\subsubsection{Aggregation of imports and domestic production for commodity $c$ per use, expressed at market price (value \& volume)}


This subsection agregates imports and domestic production for commodity $c$ for various uses. It does not do it for exports, household and Goverement final consumption ($X$, $CH$ and $G$) because these agregates are already defined in behaviour equations (see trade, consumer and Governement blocks). Expressed on value, this subsection also defines the prices indexes at market price for commodity $c$ per use as a weighted average of imported and domestic production per uses: \textit{i.e.} for $Q$ (production of commodities ), $CI$ (intermediary consumption), $I$ (private investment) and $DS$ (change in inventories). \\

\subsection{Gross Domestic Product (GDP)}



In this subsection, GDP is calculated according to different approaches. All approaches lead to same result.



\subsubsection{Expenditure approach}



\noindent\textbf{Price of GDP (expenditure definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
PGDP . GDP = PCH . CH + PG . G + PI . I + PX . X + PDS . DS - PM . M
\end{dmath}
According to expenditure approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of the different components in the final uses of goods and services. \\


\noindent\textbf{GDP (expenditure definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
GDP = CH + G + I + X + DS - M
\end{dmath}

\noindent\textbf{Price of GDP of commodity $c$ (expenditure definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
PGDP_{c} \; GDP_{c} = PCH_{c} \; CH_{c} + PG_{c} \; G_{c} + PI_{c} \; I_{c} + PX_{c} \; X_{c} + PDS_{c} \; DS_{c} - PM_{c} \; M_{c}
\end{dmath}

\noindent\textbf{GDP of commodity $c$ (expenditure definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
GDP_{c} = CH_{c} + G_{c} + I_{c} + X_{c} + DS_{c} - M_{c}
\end{dmath}

\noindent\textbf{Price of GDP (expenditure definition, for verification)} \\
\begin{dmath}
PGDP^{bis} . GDP^{bis} = \sum_{c} PGDP_{c} \; GDP_{c}
\end{dmath}
\noindent\textbf{GDP (expenditure definition, for verification)} \\
\begin{dmath}
GDP^{bis} = \sum_{c} GDP_{c}
\end{dmath}



\subsubsection{Production approach}


\noindent\textbf{Price of GDP (production definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
PGDP^{ter} . GDP^{ter} = PVA . VA + PNTAXP . NTAXP
\end{dmath}
According to production approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of the value added plus the total net taxes on commodities. \\

\noindent\textbf{ GDP (production definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
GDP^{ter} = VA + NTAXP
\end{dmath}



\subsubsection{Income approach}


\noindent\textbf{Price of GDP (income definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
PGDP4 . GDP4 = PGOS . GOS + PWAGES . WAGES + PRSSC . RSSC + NTAXI^{VAL} + PNTAXP . NTAXP
\end{dmath}
According to the income approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of all the economic incomes (from labor and capital) corrected by the social and taxes transfers. \\

\noindent\textbf{  GDP (income definition)} \\
\begin{dmath}
GDP4 = GOS + WAGES + RSSC + NTAXI + NTAXP
\end{dmath}
