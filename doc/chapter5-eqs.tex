\section{Introduction}



This appendix provides all the equations of the model. The names of variables are defined in the Glossary in the last section of the document and ranked in alphabetical order. The glossary provides also the number of the equation defining a given variable and the page where this equation is located. Because there are several versions of ThreeME, an endogenous variable may be defined more than once in the document. In such a case, it appears several time in the Glossary. \\

For instance, there are three versions of the household block: (1) the basic version where a LES utility function is assumed for all commodities; (2) the nested version where transport, car, housing and energy consumption are modeled using a nested utility function; (3) the hybrid version where transport, car, housing and energy consumption are modeled using a bottom-up model. \\

There are also several versions regarding the specification of prices and taxes on commodities: (1) the basic version where taxes are not differentiated between uses (e.g. intermediary, final consumption, export, etc.) and type (e.g. VAT, subsidies, etc.); (2) the advanced version where this differentiation is made. \\

In this appendix, $t$ is the time operator that may be omitted when no confusion arises, $e.g.$ $Z = Z_{t}$. Variables in first difference are referred as: $\varDelta\left(Z_{t}\right) = Z_{t}-Z_{t-1}$. Therefore the logarithm difference of a variable is approximately its growth rate: $\varDelta\left(\operatorname{log} Z_{t}\right) \approx Z_{t}/Z_{t-1}-1$. All parameters written in Greek letter are positive. $n$ as an exponent refers to the notional value of a given variable that is the optimal value desired by the maximization agent: $e.g.$ $Z^{n}$ is the notional value of variable $Z$. Because of adjustment constraint, effective values adjust slowly to their notional value.

\section{Supply-Use equilibrium}



This section provides the equations defining the supply use - equilibrium for the domestic and imported products and at the aggregate level. It also derives the GDP according to various definitions. All equations are therefore accounting identity. \\  \\
Each identity is expressed in value and in volume. The value equation defines therefore a price index. By convention, the variable $Z$ is always expressed in volume. $PZ$ is its price. Therefore the quantity expressed in value is $Z^{VAL} = PZ * Z$. In most case, values are expressed as $PZ * Z$. When there is a risk that a variable in volume is equal to zero in simulation, we shall defined value as $Z^{VAL}$ to avoid a division by zero issue. A typical example would be the value-added of sector $s$: $VA^{VAL}_{s} = PY_{s} \; Y_{s} - PCI_{s} \; CI_{s}$.

\subsubsection{Margins supplied (value \& volume):}



The margins supplied by commodity $m$ corresponds to the margins supplied by this commodity. By definition, the margins supplied is the sum of the margins paid (or used) on the commodities $c$. \\ \\
The margins paid on domestic and imported products ($MGPD_{m, c}$ and $MGPM_{m, c}$) are defined with behavioral equations in the producer block. They follow the domestic and imported production of commodity $c$ ($YQ_{c}$ and $M_{c}$) more or less proportionally depending on the possibility of substitutions between margins. The margins paid are then aggregated to define the margins supplied, $MGS_{m}$. The latter is then disaggregated between the domestic and imported margins supplied ($MGSD_{c}$ and $MGSM_{c}$). See specification in the producer block. \\

\noindent \textbf{Market price of the margins supplied by commodity $m$}

\subsubsection{Aggregation of imports and domestic production for commodity $c$ per use, expressed at market price (value \& volume)}


This subsection aggregates imports and domestic production for commodity $c$ for various uses. It does not do it for Exports, Households and Government final consumption ($X$, $CH$ and $G$) because these aggregates are already defined in behaviour equations (see Trade international, Consumer and Government blocks). Expressed in value, this subsection also defines the prices indexes at market price for commodity $c$ per use as a weighted average of imported and domestic production per uses: \textit{i.e.} for $Q$ (production of commodities ), $CI$ (intermediary consumption), $I$ (private investment) and $DS$ (change in inventories). \\

\section{Prices}



This file provides the equations defining the prices, wages and the interest rates. \\



\subsection{Behavioral equations}





\subsubsection{Price setting}



\noindent \textbf{Notional production price of sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlPY_n[s]}


\noindent \textbf{Notional mark-up of the sector $s$ (specification 1)} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlMARKUP_n[s]}

The notional mark-up is a positive function of the capacity utilization ratio. One can notice that this specification is strictly equivalent to: $\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} 1 + \mu^{n}_{s}\right) = \rho^{\mu,Y} . \left( \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} Y_{s}\right) - \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} YCAP_{s}\right) \right)$ which is quite close to the specification 2 below where the production capacity $YCAP_{s}$ is replaced by the past production $Y_{s, t-1}$. \\






\noindent \textbf{Notional mark-up of the sector $s$ (specification 2)} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlMARKUP_n2[s]}

This specification can be used instead of the default specification 1 above. \\

\noindent \textbf{Production capacity of the sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlYCAP[s]}

The production capacity is defined by the production function and the effective quantities of inputs. \\

\noindent \textbf{Capacity utilization ratio of the sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlCUR[s]}


\noindent \textbf{Average mark-up on commodity $c$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlMARKUP[c]}




\subsubsection{Wage setting}


\noindent \textbf{Notional wage in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlW_n[s]}

This general specification combines various wage equations found in the literature: the Phillips curve and the WS curve. The WS curve à la Layard et al. (2005) requires the following constraints: \begin{center} $\rho^{W,P}_{s} + \rho^{W,Pe}_{s} = \rho^{W,PROG}_{s} = 1, \rho^{W,U}_{s} = \rho^{W,Cons}_{s}= 0$ \end{center}
In the case of a Phillips curve, the $NAIRU$ is predetermined in the long run when wages are fully indexed on price and productivity. To have a long run "Time-Varying" $NAIRU$ under these hypotheses, we have to assume that the constant is a function of the unemployment rate (see Heyer et al. 2007): \begin{center} $d(\rho^{W,Cons}_{s}) =  \rho^{Cons,U}_{s} *\rho^{W,U}_{s} * d(UnR)$ \end{center}



\noindent \textbf{Average wage} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlW}


\noindent \textbf{Consumer Price Index} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlP}


\noindent \textbf{Gross wages paid by sector $s$ including employees (but not employers)' social contribution} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlWAGES[s]}

To derive the volume, we assume that the price of wages is the consumer price. \\

\noindent \textbf{Price index for gross wages in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlPWAGES[s]}




\subsubsection{Interest rate setting}



\noindent \textbf{Notional key interest rate of the Central Bank (Taylor rule)} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlR_n}


\noindent \textbf{Interest rate paid on capital by sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlR[s]}

We assume a constant premium on the key interest rate of the Central Bank. \\

\noindent \textbf{Interest rate paid by the Government on its debt} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlr_DEBT_G}




\subsection{Costs}



\noindent \textbf{Notional unit cost of production in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlCU_n[s]}

The notional price is based on the notional unit cost of production instead of the effective one. This leads to a more stable dynamic and gives a better representation of expectations. \\

\noindent \textbf{Unit cost of production in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlCU[s]}


\noindent \textbf{Labor cost in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlC[L, s]}



\noindent \textbf{Capital cost in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlC[K, s]}

It is preferable to calculate the user cost of capital based on the price of capital rather than on the price of investment. Indeed the price of the average capital installed is lower than the one of investment because of inflation. Using the price of investment tends to overestimate the cost of capital because it assumes that the debt contracted to finance past investments is indexed on inflation which is not the case in reality. Moreover using the price of investment often lead to unstable dynamics because it overestimate the impact of inflationary shocks on the cost of capital. \\


\noindent \textbf{Price of capital in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlPK[s]}

The price of capital is calibrated by rewriting the above equation in the long run. Its baseyear value is always smaller than 1 because it is calibrated as follows: \begin{center} $PK_{s} = \frac{PI_{s}*(\delta_{s}+GR^{REAL})*(1+GR^{PRICES})}{(Rdep_{s}-1+(1+GR^{REAL})*(1+GR^{PRICES}))}$ \end{center}

\subsection{From basic to market prices for various uses}



In the basic version of the model presented in this sub-section, we do not differentiate the market prices for various uses. For instance, the market price of household's final consumption is the same as the ones of intermediary consumption and exports. This hypotheses is often made in CGE models because it is easier to calibrate. But it is not very realistic for two reasons. First, the import content of household consumption is generally higher than the one of exports. Second, household consumption, intermediary consumption and exports are not subject to the same taxes. For instance, there is generally no VAT on exports and intermediary consumption. These hypotheses are changed in the tax block. \\

\repeatable{prices.mdlPM[c]}


\noindent \textbf{Price of domestically produced commodity $c$, expressed at market price} 
\repeatable{prices.mdlPYQS[c]}

$YQS_{c}$ is the volume of the production expressed at market price. It should not be seen as a composite of several "goods": production at base price, margins and taxes. Its does not increase when the volume of the margins and taxes increase. The price does instead. This is equivalent to assuming that $YQS_{c}$ is always proportional to and $YQ_{c}$ since the volume of margins and taxes depends on the latter. Writing it following the specification composite of several goods, $YQS_{c} = YQ_{c} + MGPD_{c} + NTAXCD_{c}$, would lead to inaccurate results since a decrease in the quantity of margins used per unit of production would not lead to a decrease of the selling price. \\

\subsection{Production factors}



\noindent \textbf{Production of commodity $c$ by sector $s$} 
\repeatable{producer.mdlY[c, s]}

We assume that each sector $s$ may produce more than one commodity $c$. Therefore the production $Y$ of commodity $c$ by sector $s$ depends on the parameter $\varphi^{Y}_{c, s}$ which represents the share of sector $s$ in the total production of commodity $c$. \\

\noindent \textbf{Aggregate production factors $f$} 
\repeatable{producer.mdlF[f]}


\noindent \textbf{Investment in commodity $c$ by sector $s$}

For a given sector, we assume that the investment structure is fixed over time. In other words, the investment good is a composite of several commodities in fixed proportion. \\

\repeatable{producer.mdlPROG[f, s]}


\noindent \textbf{Energy efficiency gains in sector $s$} 
\repeatable{producer.mdlGR_PROG[E, s]}

This specification states that the productivity gain of the energy input in sector $s$ depends on an exogenous trend and an endogenous price-induced component. Energy efficiency gains increase when the real energy price increases. This effect is assumed as irreversible: a decrease in the real energy price does not lead to a decrease in energy efficiency gains. \\

\noindent \textbf{Households' final consumption $c$} 
\repeatable{consumer.mdlCH_n[c]}

We assume a Linear Expenditure System (LES) utility function to model consumption decisions between the commodity types. A LES specification assumes that a share of the base year consumption ($NCH_{c}$) is incompressible and therefore the relation between income and consumption is not linear. This specification allows for the distinction between the consumption of necessity and luxurious goods. \\

The household marginal propensity to spend in commodity $c$, $\varphi^{MCH}_{c}$, is generally constant in a LES setting assuming implicitly an elasticity of substitution of one between commodities. We assume here a more general case where the elasticity of substitution can vary from zero to infinity. \\

\noindent \textbf{Share of commodity $c$ into the total household consumption}

\subsection{Incomes}





\subsubsection{Taxes and social contributions}



We assume that the volume of the tax varies only when the volume of the tax bases (e.g. production, consumption) varies. Hence an increase in the tax rate does not increase the volume of the tax but increases its price. This is consistent with the specification of the production price: increasing the tax rate on production increases the production price but not production. \\

In general, labor according to the national account differs from the employment according to the ILO definition. One reason is that labor is expressed in FTE (full time equivalent).

We assume that the average work duration is constant over time, implying stability of the employment to labor ratio. \\

\section{ Taxes on commodities \& Prices per uses}



There are two versions regarding the specification of prices and taxes on commodities: (1) the basic version where taxes are not differentiated between uses (e.g. intermediary, final consumption, export, etc.) and type (e.g. VAT, subsidies, etc.); (2) the advanced version where this differentiation is made. \\

This file provides the equations defining with more detail taxes and prices. In the basic version, taxes on commodities are not differentiated between uses. A constant average tax rate on each commodity is assumed. This has the advantage to require less data for the calibration. But this assumption is often unrealistic since taxes on commodities are generally differentiated per uses. For instance, VAT applies on final consumption but not on intermediary consumption or exports. Subsidies are generally higher for domestic than imported products. When the equations of this section are activated in ThreeME, the heterogeneity regarding the tax rates is taken into account. Additional data are required to disaggregate taxes. The average tax rate is not constant anymore and becomes an endogenous variable that depends on the evolution of structure of taxes and subsidies. To preserve the accountancy consistency of the model, prices have also to be amended compared to the basic version. \\



\subsection{ Taxes on commodities}





\subsubsection{Average tax rates on commodities}

\repeatable{Exception_taxes_prices.mdlNTAXCD_VAL[c]}


\noindent \textbf{Net taxes on domestically produced commodity $c$} 
\repeatable{Exception_taxes_prices.mdlNTAXCD[c]}



This is not defined anymore by simply assuming a constant rate over the production value: $NTAXCD^{VAL}_{c} = RNTAXCD_{c}*PYQ_{c}*YQ_{c}$. Different taxes are now defined depending on their basis (see below). \\

\noindent \textbf{Average tax rate on domestically produced commodity $c$} 
\repeatable{Exception_taxes_prices.mdlRNTAXCD[c]}


This rate become now endogenous by inverting the equation of $NTAXCD^{VAL}_{c}$. This specification ensures the accounting equality between the various GDP definition. \\

\repeatable{Exception_taxes_prices.mdlPSUBCD[c]}


\noindent \textbf{Subsidies on domestically produced commodity $c$} 
\repeatable{Exception_taxes_prices.mdlSUBCD[c]}


We assume that subsidies are proportional to on the volume of production which is often the cases (in particular for agriculture). Consequently the price of the subvention grows like the subvention rate. For simplicity, we assume that at the steady state, the subvention rate grows at the rate of inflation. \\

\repeatable{Exception_taxes_prices.mdlPYQSBVAT[c]}


\noindent \textbf{Production of commodity $c$ expressed at market price before VAT} 
\repeatable{Exception_taxes_prices.mdlYQSBVAT[c]}


$YQSBVAT_{c}$ is the volume of the production expressed at market price before VAT. It should \textbf{\underline{not}} be seen as a composite of several "goods": production at basic price, margins and taxes. Indeed, it does not increase when the volume of the commercial and transport margins increase. The price does instead. Consequently, $YQSBVAT_{c}$ is always proportional to $YQ_{c}$. Notice the consistency with the specification of the volume of a tax or a subvention: the tax rate does not increase the volume of the tax but increases its price. The volume of the tax increases only when the volume of the tax base (e.g. consumption, production) increases. \\
