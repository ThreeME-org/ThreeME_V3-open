# This file calibrate the data that need a conditionality. It need to be loaded last after the export of the data (see run file).
# For the equations of the model, non-zero conditionality are required to avoid a log of non positive number. They can be useful to simplify the model in the equation making aggregation. But in most cases, non zero conditionality do not need to be included for the calibration of data. There are some exceptions: e.g. when there is sum of exponential since EXP(0) = 1. These are gathered in this file.
