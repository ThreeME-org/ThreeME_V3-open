##### Supply-Use equilibrium

## This section provides the equations defining the supply use - equilibrium for the domestic and imported products and at the aggregate level. It also derives the GDP according to various definitions. All equations are therefore accounting identity. \\  \\
## Each identity is expressed in value and in volume. The value equation defines therefore a price index. By convention, the variable $Z$ is always expressed in volume. $PZ$ is its price. Therefore the quantity expressed in value is $Z^{VAL} = PZ * Z$. In most case, values are expresed as $PZ * Z$. When there is a risk that a variable in volume is equal to zero in simulation, we shall defined value as $Z^{VAL}$ to avoid a division by zero issue. A typical exemple would be the value-added of sector $s$: $VA^{VAL}_{s} = PY_{s} \; Y_{s} - PCI_{s} \; CI_{s}$.

### Domestic and foreign equilibrium for commodities $c$ (value & volume):

##! Market price for the domestically produced commodity $c$
PQD[c]  * QD[c]  = PMGSD[c] * MGSD[c] + PCID[c] * CID[c] + PCHD[c] * CHD[c] + PGD[c] * GD[c] + PID[c] * ID[c] + PXD[c] * XD[c] + PDSD[c] * DSD[c] if QD[c] <> 0

##! Quantity of domestically produced commodity $c$ expressed at market price
		  QD[c]  = 	          MGSD[c] + 		  CID[c] + 		     CHD[c] + 	   	   GD[c] + 		    ID[c] + 		 XD[c] + 		   DSD[c] if QD[c] <> 0

##! Market price for imported commodity $c$
PQM[c]  * QM[c]  = PMGSM[c] * MGSM[c] + PCIM[c] * CIM[c] + PCHM[c] * CHM[c] + PGM[c] * GM[c] + PIM[c] * IM[c] + PXM[c] * XM[c] + PDSM[c] * DSM[c] if QM[c] <> 0

##! Quantity of imported commodity $c$ expressed at market price

### Margins supplied (value & volume):
# TO BE CHANGED !!: Margins paid --> Margins used / Margins supplied -->  margins supplied
## The margins supplied by commodity $m$ corresponds to the margins supplied by this commodity. By definition, the margins supplied is the sum of the margins paid (or used) on the commodities $c$. \\ \\
## The margins paid on domestic and imported products ($MGPD_{m, c}$ and $MGPM_{m, c}$) are defined with behavorial equations in the producer block. They follow the domestic and imported production of commodity $c$ ($YQ_{c}$ and $M_{c}$) more or less proportionnally depending on the possibility of substitutions between margins. The margins paid are then aggregated to define the margins supplied, $MGS_{m}$. The latter is then disagrated between the domestic and imported margins supplied ($MGSD_{c}$ and $MGSM_{c}$). See specification in the producer block. \\

##! Market price of the margins supplied by commodity $m$
PMGS[m] * MGS[m]  = sum(PMGP[m, c] * MGP[m, c] 	if MGP[m, c] <> 0 on c) 	   if MGS[m]    <> 0

##! Margins supplied by commodity $m$, expressed at market price
           MGS[m]  = sum(    	 	    MGP[m, c] 	if MGP[m, c] <> 0 on c) 	   if MGS[m]    <> 0
## The margins supplied correspond to the sum of the margins paid to commodity $m$ over all the commodities $c$ \\

##! Market price of the margins supplied by commodity $m$ (for verification)
PMGSbis[m] * MGSbis[m] = PMGSD[m] * MGSD[m] + PMGSM[m] * MGSM[m] 				   if MGSbis[m]  <> 0
## Same variable as $PMGS_{m}$ above to check the accounting consistency. \\

##! Margins supplied by commodity $m$, expressed at market price (for verification)
			 MGSbis[m] = 		    MGSD[m] + 			 MGSM[m] 				   if MGSbis[m]  <> 0
## Same variable as $MGS_{m}$ above to check the accounting consistency. \\

### Aggregation of imports and domestic production for commodity $c$ per use, expressed at market price (value & volume)
## This subsection aggregates imports and domestic production for commodity $c$ for various uses. It does not do it for Exports, Households and Government final consumption ($X$, $CH$ and $G$) because these aggregates are already defined in behaviour equations (see Trade international, Consumer and Governement blocks). Expressed in value, this subsection also defines the prices indexes at market price for commodity $c$ per use as a weighted average of imported and domestic production per uses: \textit{i.e.} for $Q$ (production of commodities ), $CI$ (intermediary consumption), $I$ (private investment) and $DS$ (change in inventories). \\

PYQ     * YQ 		= sum(PYQ[c]     * YQ[c] 		if YQ[c] 	  <> 0 on c) 		if YQ 		 <> 0

##! Domestic production, expressed at basic price
	      YQ 		= sum(		       YQ[c] 		if YQ[c] 	  <> 0 on c) 		if YQ 		 <> 0

##! Aggregate basic price of imports
PM      * M 		= sum(PM[c]      * M[c]    	 	if M[c] 	  <> 0 on c) 		if M 		 <> 0

##! Imports, expressed at basic price
	      M 		= sum(	           M[c] 		if M[c] 	  <> 0 on c) 		if M 		 <> 0


### Supply indicators of sector $s$ (value & volume):

##! Production of sector $s$, expressed at basic price
		Y[s]        = sum(Y[c, s] 			 	    if Y[c, s]    <> 0 on c) 		if Y[s] 	 <> 0
## The production price of sector $s$ is defined in the producer block as a behavour equation. It can not therefore be defined here as an index. \\

##! Value-added of sector $s$ expressed in value
VA_VAL[s] = PY[s] * Y[s] - PCI[s] * CI[s]

##! Value-added of sector $s$
VA[s] 	  = 		Y[s] - 			CI[s]

##! Gross operating surplus of sector $s$ expressed in value
GOS_VAL[s] = VA_VAL[s] - PWAGES[s] * WAGES[s] - PRSC[s] * RSC[s] - NTAXS_VAL[s]
## The standard definition of the Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) generally include tax on profits. For simplicity, we assume that $NTAXS_{s}$ includes all net taxes on capital (i.e. tax on production and profits). In our definition, the tax on profit is therefore excluded from the GOS. This should be taken into account if one wants to use the GOS as a basis for the tax on profits. \\

##! Gross operating surplus of sector $s$
GOS[s] 	   = VA[s] 	   - 			 WAGES[s] - 		   RSC[s] - NTAXS[s]

##! Net operating surplus of sector $s$ expressed in value
NOS_VAL[s] = GOS_VAL[s] - PK[s]{-1} 				  * Rdep[s] * F[K, s]{-1}

##! Net operating surplus of sector $s$
NOS[s] 	   = GOS[s]     - @elem(PK[s]{-1}, %baseyear) * Rdep[s] * F[K, s]{-1}


### Aggregation on sectors: supply indicators of all sectors  (value & volume)

##! Basic price of aggregate production
PY * Y              = sum(PY[s] * Y[s] 				if Y[s] 	  <> 0 on s) 		if Y 		 <> 0

##! Aggregate production, expressed at basic price
	 Y              = sum( 		  Y[s] 			    if Y[s] 	  <> 0 on s) 		if Y 		 <> 0

##! Value-added price
PVA * VA = sum(VA_VAL[s] on s)

##! Aggregate value-added
	  VA = sum(VA[s]     on s)

##! Gross wage index paid by sectors
PWAGES * WAGES = sum(PWAGES[s] * WAGES[s] if WAGES[s] <> 0 on s) if WAGES <> 0
## The gross wage includes employees (but not employers)' social contribution \\


##! Aggregate gross wages paid by sectors
		 WAGES = sum(			 WAGES[s] if WAGES[s] <> 0 on s) if WAGES <> 0


##! Price of the aggregate gross operating surplus
PGOS * GOS = sum(GOS_VAL[s] on s)

##! Aggregate gross operating surplus
	   GOS = sum(GOS[s] 	on s)

##! Price of the aggregate net operating surplus
PNOS * NOS = sum(NOS_VAL[s] on s)

##! Aggregate net operating surplus
	   NOS = sum(NOS[s] 	on s)

#### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

## In this subsection, GDP is calculated according to different approaches. All approaches lead to same result.

### Expenditure approach

##! Price of GDP (expenditure definition)
PGDP 	* GDP 	 = PCH 	  * CH	  + PG 	  * G 	 + PI 	 * I 	+ PX 	* X    + PDS    * DS 	- PM    * M
## According to the expenditure approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of the different components in the final uses of goods and services. \\


##! GDP (expenditure definition)
		  GDP 	 = 	     	CH 	  + 	    G 	 + 	  	   I 	+ 	 	  X    + 	   	  DS 	- 	 	  M

##! Price of GDP of commodity $c$ (expenditure definition)
PGDP[c] * GDP[c] = PCH[c] * CH[c] + PG[c] * G[c] + PI[c] * I[c] + PX[c] * X[c] + PDS[c] * DS[c] - PM[c] * M[c] 		if GDP[c] <> 0

##! GDP of commodity $c$ (expenditure definition)
		  GDP[c] = 			CH[c] + 		G[c] + 		   I[c] + 		  X[c] + 		  DS[c] - 		  M[c]		if GDP[c] <> 0

##! Price of GDP (expenditure definition, for verification)
PGDPbis * GDPbis = sum(PGDP[c] * GDP[c] on c)
##! GDP (expenditure definition, for verification)
		  GDPbis = sum(		  	 GDP[c] on c)

### Production approach
##! Price of GDP (production definition)
PGDPter * GDPter = PVA * VA + PNTAXC * NTAXC
## According to the production approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of the value added plus the total net taxes on commodities. \\

##!  GDP (production definition)
		  GDPter = 		 VA + 		   NTAXC

### Income approach
##! Price of GDP (income definition)
PGDP4 	* GDP4   = PGOS * GOS + PWAGES * WAGES + PRSC * RSC + NTAXS_VAL + PNTAXC * NTAXC
## According to the income approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of all the economic incomes (from labor and capital) corrected by the social and taxes transfers. \\

##!   GDP (income definition)
		  GDP4   = 		  GOS + 		 WAGES + 		 RSC + NTAXS 	  + 		 NTAXC
