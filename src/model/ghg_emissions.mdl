##### Greenhouse gases emissions
## This section provides the equations defining the path of GreenHouse Gases (GHG) emissions. All emission types are expressed in $CO_{2}$-equivalent (GWP factors are taken from the fifth IPCC report) to facilitate aggregation. For the same emission type (e.g. $CO_{2}$), several equation are defined depending on the emission source: intermediary consumption, household consumption or production. \\

#Emissions are defined for the following list: $ghg = {CO2;CH4;N2O;SF6;HFC;PFC}$

#### Behavioural equations

##! Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$ related to the intermediary consumption of commodity $c$ by sector $s$
d(log(EMS_CI[ghg,c,s])) = d(log(CI[c,s]   * IEMS_CI[ghg,c,s]))              if EMS_CI[ghg,c,s] <> 0
## In practice only a few intermediaries generate emissions (e.g. coal, gas, petrol). $IEMS^{CI}_{ghg,c,s}$ is the corresponding emission intensity calibrated to 1 in the baseyear. It may change over time because of the increase in the share of biofuels. \\

##! Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$ related to the  materials consumption of sector $s$
d(log(EMS_MAT[ghg,s]))  = d(log(F[MAT,s]  * IEMS_MAT[ghg,s]))           if EMS_MAT[ghg,s] <> 0
## This mainly corresponds to the $CO_{2}$ emissions from decarbonation. \\

##! Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$ related to the final production of sector $s$
d(log(EMS_Y[ghg,s]))    = d(log(Y[s]      * IEMS_Y[ghg,s]))             if EMS_Y[ghg,s]   <> 0
## This mainly corresponds to the emissions from agriculture. \\

##! Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$ related to the household consumption $c$
d(log(EMS_CH[ghg,c]))   = d(log(CH[c]     * IEMS_CH[ghg,c]))            if EMS_CH[ghg,c]  <> 0
