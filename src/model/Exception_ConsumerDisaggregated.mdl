##### Consumer disaggregated
## This section provides the equations defining the households' income structure per type of households as well as their consumption and savings behaviour. \\


#### Households' income

##! Disposable income before tax of household $h$ expressed in value 
DISPINC_BT_VAL[h]   = WAGES_VAL[h] + PROP_INC_H_VAL[h] + SOC_BENF_VAL[h] + TRSF_HH_VAL[h]

##! Gross wages of household $h$
WAGES_VAL[h]= phi_WAGES[h] * PWAGES * WAGES

##! Disposable income after tax of household $h$ expressed in value 
DISPINC_AT_VAL[h]   = DISPINC_BT_VAL[h] - INC_SOC_TAX_VAL[h]

##! Income and social taxes expressed in value of household $h$
INC_SOC_TAX_VAL[h]  = RINC_SOC_TAX[h] * DISPINC_BT_VAL[h] - T2VAL_CH * REDIS_CT_H[h]

##! Property incomes of household $h$ expressed in value 
PROP_INC_H_VAL[h] = phi_PROP_INC_H[h] * PROP_INC_H_VAL

##! Social benefits of household $h$ expressed in value
SOC_BENF_VAL[h] = phi_SOC_BENF[h] * SOC_BENF_VAL

#### Households' expenditures

##! Aggregate notional households final consumption of household $h$ expressed in value
CH_n_VAL[h]  = DISPINC_AT_VAL[h] * (1 - MPS_n[h])

##! Notional marginal propensity to save of household $h$ 
d(MPS_n[h])  = RHO_MPS_R[h] * d(R - d(P)/P{-1}) + RHO_MPS_UnR[h] * d(UnR)

##! Household $h$ 's final consumption $c$
(CH_n[c, h] - NCH[c, h]) * PCH[c] = phi_MCH[c, h] * (CH_n_VAL[h] - PNCH[h] * NCH[h])  if CH[c, h] <> 0

##! Share of commodity $c$ into the household $h$ 's total marginal consumption
d(log(phi_MCH[c, h])) = (1 - ES_LESCES[h]) * d(log(PCH[c] / PCH_CES[h]))     if phi_MCH[c, h] <> 0

##! CES consumption price index of household $h$
PCH_CES[h] = (sum(@elem(phi_MCH[c, h], %baseyear) * PCH[c] ^ (1 - ES_LESCES[h]) on c)) ^ (1 / (1 - ES_LESCES[h])) if ES_LESCES[h] <> 1

##! Household $h$ 's savings expressed in value
SAV_H_VAL[h]  = DISPINC_AT_VAL[h] - PCH[h] * CH[h]

##! Household $h$ 's savings rate
RSAV_H_VAL[h] = SAV_H_VAL[h] / DISPINC_AT_VAL[h]

#### Aggregations
##!Notional households' final consumption $c$
@over CH_n[c] =  sum(CH_n[c, h] on h)

##! Agregate notional marginal propensity to save
@over (1 - MPS_n) = CH_n_VAL / DISPINC_AT_VAL

##! Disposable income after tax expressed in value
@over DISPINC_AT_VAL = sum(DISPINC_AT_VAL[h] on h) 

##! Aggregate notional households final consumption expressed in value
@over CH_n_VAL = sum(CH_n_VAL[h] on h)

##! Price of aggregate necessary household $h$ 's consumption
PNCH[h] * NCH[h] = sum(PNCH[c] * NCH[c, h] if NCH[c, h] <> 0 on c) if NCH[h] <> 0

##! Aggregate necessary household $h$ 's final consumption
	   NCH[h] = sum(NCH[c, h] if NCH[c, h] <> 0 on c) if NCH[h] <> 0

##! Price of aggregate necessary household $h$ 's consumption
PCH[h] * CH[h] = sum(PCH[c] * CH[c, h] if CH[c, h] <> 0 on c) if CH[h] <> 0

##! Aggregate necessary households final consumption
	   CH[h] = sum(CH[c, h] if CH[c, h] <> 0 on c) if CH[h] <> 0
