### Taxes and social contributions

## We assume that the volume of the tax varies only when the volume of the taxe bases (e.g. production, consumption) varies. Hence an increase in the tax rate does not increase the volume of the tax but increases its price. This is coherent with the specification of the production price: increasing the tax rate on production increases the production price but not production. \\

##! Net taxes on domestically produced commodity $c$ expressed in value
NTAXCD_VAL[c] = 			RNTAXCD[c]	* PYQ[c]	  * YQ[c]

##! Net taxes on domestically produced commodity $c$
NTAXCD[c] 		= @elem(RNTAXCD[c], %baseyear)  * YQ[c]

##! Net taxes on imported commodity $c$ expressed in value
NTAXCM_VAL[c]  = 	 	   RNTAXCM[c]	* PM[c] 	  * M[c]

##! Net taxes on imported commodity $c$
NTAXCM[c] 		 = @elem(RNTAXCM[c], %baseyear) * M[c]

##! Net taxes on commodity $c$ expressed in value
NTAXC_VAL[c] 	 = NTAXCD_VAL[c] + NTAXCM_VAL[c]

##! Net taxes on commodity $c$
NTAXC[c] 		 	 = NTAXCD[c] 		 + NTAXCM[c]

##! Net taxes on the production of sector $s$ expressed in value
NTAXS_VAL[s] 	 = 			 RNTAXS[s]	* PY[s]	    * Y[s]

##! Net taxes on the production of sector $s$
NTAXS[s] 		   = @elem(RNTAXS[s], %baseyear)  * Y[s]

##! Employers' social security contribution paid by sector $s$
RSC[s] * PRSC[s] = W[s] * F[L, s] * RRSC[s]

##! Price of the employers' social security contribution paid by sector $s$
		  		PRSC[s] = P

### Aggregate taxes and social contributions

##! Aggregate net taxes on commodity $c$ expressed in value
PNTAXC * NTAXC = sum(NTAXC_VAL[c] on c)

##! Aggregate net taxes on commodity $c$
	     	 NTAXC = sum(NTAXC[c] 		on c)

##! Aggregate net taxes on the production of sectors expressed in value
NTAXS_VAL = sum(NTAXS_VAL[s] on s)

##! Aggregate net taxes on the production of sectors
NTAXS 		= sum(NTAXS[s] 		 on s)

##! Price of the aggregate employers' social security contribution paid by sector $s$
PRSC * RSC = sum(PRSC[s] * RSC[s] on s)

##! Aggregate employers' social security contribution paid by sectors
		    RSC = sum(			      RSC[s] on s)

##! Average employers' social security contribution rate
RRSC 			 = 		 (PRSC 	* RSC) / (W * F[L])

### Other and aggregate incomes

##! Notional property incomes of the Government expressed in value
PROP_INC_G_VAL_n  = phi_PROP_INC_G * PNOS * NOS + (PNOS * NOS <= 0.00001 ) * (0.00001 - phi_PROP_INC_G * PNOS * NOS)

##! Aggregate incomes of the Government expressed in value
INC_G_VAL 			  = PNTAXC * NTAXC + NTAXS_VAL + INC_SOC_TAX_VAL + PRSC * RSC + PROP_INC_G_VAL

#### Spendings

##!  Government final consumption of commodity $c$
d(log(G[c])) = d(log(EXPG)) if G[c] <> 0

##! Aggregate spendings of the Government expressed in value
SPEND_G_VAL 		  = PG  * G  + SOC_BENF_VAL + DEBT_G_VAL{-1}*(Phi_RD_G{-1} + r_DEBT_G{-1})

#### Deficit and debt

##! Savings of the Government expressed in value 
SAV_G_VAL 	  	  = INC_G_VAL - SPEND_G_VAL
## It corresponds to the net lending/borrowing, which is the published deficit/savings of the Government. \\

##! Primary balance of the Government expressed in value (deficit)
Bal_G_Prim_VAL 		= SAV_G_VAL + DEBT_G_VAL{-1} * (Phi_RD_G{-1} + r_DEBT_G{-1})
## It corresponds to the savings excluding the reimbursement and the interest on the debt. \\

##! Primary balance of the Government expressed in value (deficit) (for verification)
Bal_G_Prim_VALbis = INC_G_VAL - (PG  * G  + SOC_BENF_VAL)

##! Total balance of the Government expressed in value (deficit)
Bal_G_Tot_VAL 	  = Bal_G_Prim_VAL - DEBT_G_VAL{-1} * r_DEBT_G{-1}

##! Government's debt expressed in value
DEBT_G_VAL 		 	  = DEBT_G_VAL{-1} * (1-Phi_RD_G{-1}) - SAV_G_VAL
## It corresponds to the previous year debt minus the reimbursement of the debt and the government savings. \\

##! Government's savings rate expressed in value (in percent of GDP)
RSAV_G_VAL 			  = SAV_G_VAL 		 / (PGDP * GDP)

##! Primary balance of the Government expressed in value (in percent of GDP)
RBal_G_Prim_VAL   = Bal_G_Prim_VAL / (PGDP * GDP)

##! Total balance of the Government expressed in value (in percent of GDP)
RBal_G_Tot_VAL 	  = Bal_G_Tot_VAL  / (PGDP * GDP)

##! Ratio of the Government's debt expressed in value (in percent of GDP)
RDEBT_G_VAL 		  = DEBT_G_VAL 		 / (PGDP * GDP)
