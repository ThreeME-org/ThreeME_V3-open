### taxes

# We assume that the volume of the tax varies only when the volume of the taxe bases (e.g. production, consumption) varies. Hence an increase in the tax rate does not increase the volume of the tax but increases its price. This is coherent with the specification of the price of the tax bases: increasing the tax rate on production increases the production price but not production.

## Net taxes on domestically produced commodity $c$ in value
NTAXPD_VAL[c] = 			RNTAXPD[c]	* PYQ[c]	  * YQ[c]

## Net taxes on domestically produced commodity $c$ in volume
NTAXPD[c] 		= @elem(RNTAXPD[c], %baseyear)  * YQ[c]

## Net taxes on imported commodity $c$ in value
NTAXPM_VAL[c]  = 	 	   RNTAXPM[c]	* PM[c] 	  * M[c]

## Net taxes on imported commodity $c$ in volume
NTAXPM[c] 		 = @elem(RNTAXPM[c], %baseyear) * M[c]


# Same remark than for VA
## Net taxes on commodity $c$ in value
NTAXP_VAL[c] 	 = NTAXPD_VAL[c] + NTAXPM_VAL[c]

## Net taxes on commodity $c$ in volume
NTAXP[c] 		 	 = NTAXPD[c] 		 + NTAXPM[c]

## Aggregate net taxes on commodity $c$ in value
PNTAXP * NTAXP = sum(NTAXP_VAL[c] on c)

## Aggregate net taxes on commodity $c$ in volume
	     	 NTAXP = sum(NTAXP[c] 		on c)

## Net taxes on production of sector $s$ in value
NTAXI_VAL[s] 	 = 			 RNTAXI[s]	* PY[s]	    * Y[s]

## Net taxes on production of sector $s$ in volume
NTAXI[s] 		   = @elem(RNTAXI[s], %baseyear)  * Y[s]

## Aggregate net taxes on production (value & volume)
# Same remark than for VA

## Net taxes on production in value
NTAXI_VAL = sum(NTAXI_VAL[s] on s)

## Net taxes on production in volume
NTAXI 		= sum(NTAXI[s] 		 on s)

## Employers' social security contribution paid by sector $s$ expressed in consumer price
## $RSSC$ stands for employeRs' Social Security Contribution
RSSC[s] * PRSSC[s] = W[s] * F[L, s] * RRSSC[s]

## Price of RSSC for sector $s$
		  		PRSSC[s] = P

## Total employers' social security contribution expressed in consumer price
PRSSC * RSSC = sum(PRSSC[s] * RSSC[s] on s)

## Price of RSSC
				RSSC = sum(						RSSC[s] on s)

## Average employers' social security contribution rate
RRSSC 			 = 		 PRSSC 		* RSSC / (W * F[L])

##  Government final consumption expenditure of commodity $c$
d(log(G[c])) = d(log(EXPG)) if G[c] <> 0

## Notional Property incomes of the Government in value
PROP_INC_G_VAL_n  = phi_PROP_INC_G * PNOS * NOS + (PNOS * NOS <= 0.00001 ) * (0.00001 - phi_PROP_INC_G * PNOS * NOS)

## Incomes of the Government in value
INC_G_VAL 			  = PNTAXP * NTAXP + NTAXI_VAL + INC_SOC_TAX_VAL + PRSSC * RSSC + PROP_INC_G_VAL

## Spendings of the Government in value
SPEND_G_VAL 		  = PG  * G  + SOC_BENF_VAL + DEBT_G_VAL{-1}*(Phi_RD_G{-1} + r_DEBT_G{-1})

## Savings of the Government in value (Net lending/borrowing: published deficit/savings of the Government)
SAV_G_VAL 	  	  = INC_G_VAL - SPEND_G_VAL

## Primary balance of the Government in value (deficit).
## It corresponds to the savings excluding the reimbursement and the interest on the debt

Bal_G_Prim_VAL 		= SAV_G_VAL + DEBT_G_VAL{-1} * (Phi_RD_G{-1} + r_DEBT_G{-1})

# NO COMMENT
Bal_G_Prim_VALbis = INC_G_VAL - (PG  * G  + SOC_BENF_VAL)

## Total balance of the Government in value (deficit)
# It corresponds to the saving excluding the reimbursement but not the interest on the debt

Bal_G_Tot_VAL 	  = Bal_G_Prim_VAL - DEBT_G_VAL{-1} * r_DEBT_G{-1}

## Government's debt in value
# It corresponds to the previous year debt minus the reimbursement of the debt and the government savings
DEBT_G_VAL 		 	  = DEBT_G_VAL{-1} * (1-Phi_RD_G{-1}) - SAV_G_VAL

## Government's savings rate in value (in percent of GDP)
RSAV_G_VAL 			  = SAV_G_VAL 		 / (PGDP * GDP)

## Primary balance of the Government in value (in percent of GDP)
RBal_G_Prim_VAL   = Bal_G_Prim_VAL / (PGDP * GDP)

## Total balance of the Government in value (in percent of GDP)
RBal_G_Tot_VAL 	  = Bal_G_Tot_VAL  / (PGDP * GDP)

## Ratio of the Government's debt in value (in percent of GDP)
RDEBT_G_VAL 		  = DEBT_G_VAL 		 / (PGDP * GDP)
