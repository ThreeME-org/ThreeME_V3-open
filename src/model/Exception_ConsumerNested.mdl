##### Nested utility function for the consumer

## This section provides the equations defining the consumer’s nested utility function. In the basic version of the consumer block (see Section Consumer), the consumption of every commodity is modeled using generalized LES utility function where the elasticity of substitution between every commodity is constant. An increase in the price of fossil energy will increase the consumption of the other commodities uniformly whereas one expects that substitutions will mainly affect the other energy sources and household’s investment in more energy-efficient equipment. This block amends the basic version by introducing a nested utility function. \\

## The first level separates the consumption related to housing ($CH^{HOUS}$) and transport ($CH^{TRSP}$) from the rest. We assume that the value shares of the three types of expenditures (housing, transport and other) are constant which amount to assuming an Elasticity of Substitution (ES) of one (Cobb-Douglas hypothesis). \\

## At the second level of the nest, housing expenditures ($CH^{HOUS}$) are disaggregated between energy expenditures ($CH^{HOUSENER}$) and investment expenditures ($CH^{HOUSINV}$). Transport expenditures ($CH^{TRSP}$) are disaggregated between transport types. \\

## At the third level of the nest, energy housing related expenditures ($CH^{HOUSENER}$) are disaggregated between energy types ($CH^{HOUSENER}_{ce}$). Automobile expenditures ($CH^{TRSP}_{auto}$) are disaggregated between energy expenditure ($CH^{TRSPENER}$) and investment expenditure ($CH^{TRSPINV}$). \\

## At the fourth level of the nest, energy transport related expenditure ($CH^{TRSPENER}$) are disaggregated between energy types ($CH^{HOUSENER}_{ce}$). Except for the first level were the ES is one, in the other levels of the nest, the ES can be chosen freely. \\

#### Link with the consumer block of ThreeME
## When this block is activated, the expenditures related to construction, transport, vehicles and energy commodities are not defined anymore by the basic version of the consumer block (see Section Consumer). To do so the necessary (minimum) households' final consumption for this commodity is endogenized and calibrated at their total at the base year: $NCH_{c} = CH_{c}$ for $c$ $\in$  $\{ ccon,ct,cveh,ce \}$. In other words, we assume that these expenditures have the priority over the other ones. \\

##! Necessary (minimum) households' final consumption for construction commodity $ccon$
NCH[ccon] = CH_HOUSINV_VAL / PNCH[ccon]

##! Necessary (minimum) households' final consumption for transport commodities $ct$
NCH[ct] = CH_TRSP_VAL[ct] / PCH[ct]

##! Necessary (minimum) households' final consumption for vehicles commodity $cveh$
NCH[cveh] = CH_TRSPINV_VAL / PNCH[cveh]

##! Necessary (minimum) households' final consumption for energy commodities $ce$
NCH[ce] = CH_HOUS[ce] + CH_TRSP[ce]
