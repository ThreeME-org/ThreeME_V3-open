##### Introduction

## This appendix provides all the equations of the model. Note that there are two versions of the household block: (1) the standard version where a LES utility function is assumed for all commodities; (2) the hybrid version where transport, car, housing and energy consumption are modeled separately. \\ \\
## In this appendix, $t$ is the time operator that may be omitted when no confusion arises, $e.g.$ $Z = Z_{t}$. Variables in first difference are referred as : $\varDelta\left(Z_{t}\right) = Z_{t}-Z_{t-1}$. Therefore the logarithm difference of a variable is approximativelly its growth rate: $\varDelta\left(\operatorname{log} Z_{t}\right) \approx Z_{t}/Z_{t-1}-1$. All parameters written in Greek letter are positive. $n$ as an exponent refers to the notional value of a given variable that is the optimal value desired by the maximization agent: $e.g.$ $Z^{n}$ is the notional value of variable $Z$. Because of adjustment constraint, effective values adjust slowly to their notional value.
