### Exceptions to run an Input-Output model

########### Step 1
# Direct effects without multipliers
## Run with all @over activated. For the subsequent steps, desactivate the relevant @over and run.  

########### Step 2
# Block the multiplicator of intermediaries
@over d(log(CI[c, s])) = d(log(GDP_trend)) if CI[c, s] <> 0

########### Step 3

# Block the multiplicator of transport and trade margins 
@over d(log(MGPD[m, c])) = d(log(GDP_trend)) if MGPD[m, c] <> 0
@over d(log(MGPM[m, c])) = d(log(GDP_trend)) if MGPM[m, c] <> 0

########### Step 4

# Block the multiplicator of investment

@over d(log(IA[s])) = d(log(GDP_trend)) if F_K[s] <> 0


########### Step 5

# Block the multiplicator of consumption

@over d(log(CH_n[c])) = d(log(GDP_trend)) if CH_n[c] <> 0

########### Step 6
# Block prices effects: Wages and prices grow at a constant rate

## In addition to the behavioural equation (notional wage and price), we need to block other prices because they are modified by a change in production share (for PYQ[c]) or by a change in transport and trade margins intensity (for PYQS[c] and PMS[c]). Margins intensity changes when we make the transport and trade margins exogenous.
