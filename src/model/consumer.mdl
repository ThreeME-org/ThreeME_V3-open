##### Consumer

#### Households' income
##! Disposable income before tax expressed in value
DISPINC_BT_VAL   = PWAGES * WAGES + PROP_INC_H_VAL + SOC_BENF_VAL + TRSF_HH_VAL
## The disposable income before tax is used as base for the income tax. \\

##! Disposable income after tax expressed in value
DISPINC_AT_VAL   = DISPINC_BT_VAL - INC_SOC_TAX_VAL
## The definition of the disposable income after tax corresponds to the definition of "gross disposable income" defined in the annual account by institutional sector of Eurostat (b.6.g). \\

##! Income and social taxes expressed in value
INC_SOC_TAX_VAL  = RINC_SOC_TAX * DISPINC_BT_VAL

##! Property incomes expressed in value
PROP_INC_H_VAL_n = phi_PROP_INC_H * PNOS * NOS + (PNOS * NOS <= 0.00001 ) * (0.00001 - phi_PROP_INC_H * PNOS * NOS)

##! Social benefits expressed in value
SOC_BENF_VAL     = RR_POP * @elem(W, %baseyear) * PROG_L * P * POP + RR_Un * W * Un

# Rendre endogène avec vrai données!!!
# The replacement ratio should be endogenous because of the duration limit of unemployment benefits. To be tested.
# d(log(RR_Un)) = - 1.0 * d(log(UnR))

# Transfers to households
# Should be endogenous? Check V2
# TRSF_HH_VAL = ?????

#### Households' expenditures

##! Aggregate notional households final consumption expressed in value
CH_n_VAL = DISPINC_AT_VAL * (1 - MPS_n)

##! Notional marginal propensity to save
d(MPS_n)= RHO_MPS_R * d(R - d(P)/P{-1}) + RHO_MPS_UnR * d(UnR)

# Test of the financial block suggest that the following specification lead to more stable results.
# d(MPS_n)= RHO_MPS_P * d(d(P)/P{-1}) + RHO_MPS_UnR * d(UnR)
# To be tested

##! Households' final consumption $c$
(CH_n[c] - NCH[c]) * PCH[c] = phi_MCH[c] * (CH_n_VAL - PNCH * NCH)  if CH[c]      <> 0
## We assume a Linear Expenditure System (LES) utility function to model consumption decisions between the commodity types. A LES specication assumes that a share of the base year consumption ($NCH_{c}$) is incompressible and therefore the relation between income and consumption is not linear. This specication allows for the distinction between the consumption of necessity and luxurious goods. \\

##! Price of necessary households consumption $c$
PNCH[c] = PCH[c]

##! Price of agregate necessary households consumption
PNCH * NCH = sum(PNCH[c] * NCH[c] on c) if NCH <> 0

##! Aggregate necessary households final consumption
	   NCH = sum(NCH[c] 		  on c) if NCH <> 0

##! Share of commodity $c$ into the total marginal household consumption
d(log(phi_MCH[c])) = (1 - ES_LESCES) * d(log(PCH[c] / PCH_CES))     if phi_MCH[c] <> 0
## The household marginal propension to spend in commodity $c$, $\varphi^{MCH}_{c}$, is generaly constant in a LES setting assuming implicitly an elastiscity of substitution of one between comodities. We assume here a more general case where the elastiscity of substitution can vary from zero to infinity. \\  

##! Share of commodity $c$ into the total household consumption
Phi_CH[c] = CH[c]/CH                                                if CH[c]      <> 0
## Notice that if $NCH_{c} = 0$, $\varphi^{CH}_{c} = \varphi^{MCH}_{c}$.\\

##! CES consumption price index
PCH_CES = (sum(@elem(phi_MCH[c], %baseyear) * PCH[c] ^ (1 - ES_LESCES) on c)) ^ (1 / (1 - ES_LESCES)) if ES_LESCES <> 1

##! Households savings expressed in value
SAV_H_VAL  = DISPINC_AT_VAL - PCH * CH

##! Households savings rate
RSAV_H_VAL = SAV_H_VAL / DISPINC_AT_VAL

##! Households savings stock
Stock_SAV_H_VAL = Stock_SAV_H_VAL{-1} + SAV_H_VAL
